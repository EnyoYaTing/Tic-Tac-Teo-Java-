Code Quality Feedback for 70988:

Some of your method names are potentially problematic in that they don't conform
to recommendations (they aren't verbs, checks or event handlers), are just
single words and start with an uppercase letter. Your variable names are also
generally quite short and as a result it is sometimes difficult to infer their
purpose. The "Display" class has very deep nesting, which could make it
difficult to maintain in the long term. Be aware that there are some tightly
coupled pairs of classes (Oxo<->Player and Board<->Player) which may benefit
from refactoring to improve encapsulation and separation. Your code might
benefit from some additional descriptive comments. There are declared but unused
private fields in a some of your classes (Ai->rand, Board->currentPlayerMark,
Display->board and Oxo->computer). Significant amounts of code has been
replicated in Board. Avoid copy-and-paste duplication: keep your code DRY !
